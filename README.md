# Real GPS Map mod and script

Mod with specialization for display PDA map on screen anywhere in 3D space, not only HUD. Perfectly fits to any ingame monitor.

Brief overview of possibilities:

- Specialization for vehicles
- Display PDA map on any position in game.
- User can zoom in/out
- Two different rotate mode (player icon rotates on map, or map rotates along player icon)
- User can increase/decrease player size
- Configuration what players could do and what they couldn't (eg. you can forbid player size change)
- Works on any map with correctly set PDA map (result will be same as in HUD map (key 9))
